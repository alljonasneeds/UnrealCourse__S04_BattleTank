##Concept
You are playing 1v1 against another human in arena type match, where the first to a certain number of kills wins the game. Maybe you can select between 2 or 3 different tanks. You have to maneuver across a terrain consisting of different ground types, like grass, asphalt or sand, that slow your tank or make it slip, as well as slopes and hills to take cover and climb with the tank. But you have to be careful not to flip your tank.
##Rules
*The first player to 3 kills wins.
*Each time you spawn you can select a tank type.
*Tanks have health, that decreases on hit.
*On respawn health is refreshed.
*You can move anywhere, the only boundaries are determined by mountains, that make your tank flip. 
##Requirements
*Tank assets (body, tracks, headmount and barrel) (will be scalled differently for different tank types, as well as colour adjustments)
*Materials for different Terrains
*Sounds: Engine, Gunshot, Tracks for different Terrains, Ambience
*A way to make the tank aim, where the player controller is aiming (I could not get the look at rotation working properly for a previous project).
*maybe Simple AI to practice against
